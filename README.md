# CAP6415_F25_project-FineTuningRobustCNN
Fine-tuning compact CNNs to improve robustness against image corruptions such as noise, blur, and brightness distortion using CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-10-C datasets. The project evaluates whether lightweight models like EfficientNet-B0 and MobileNetV3 can maintain accuracy under real-world visual degradations.

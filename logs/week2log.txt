CAP6415 Project - Week 2 Log
Project Title: Fine-Tuning Compact CNNs for Robust Image Recognition on Corrupted Data
Week ending: November 17, 2025

Summary:
This week I implemented and validated a CIFAR-10-C dataloader in Colab, inspected per-corruption .npy files, and ran baseline evaluations using a pretrained EfficientNet-B0. Results (per-corruption and per-severity accuracies) were saved to results/baseline_metrics.csv.

Key actions completed:
- Verified all corruption files in /content/CIFAR-10-C: each contains 50,000 images (5 severities × 10,000).
- Implemented and tested dataloader functions: list_corruptions, load_cifar10c_corruption, load_all_corruptions.
- Executed baseline evaluation (EfficientNet-B0 pretrained) and produced results/baseline_metrics.csv.
- Saved representative sample images to results/samples/ for qualitative inspection.

Representative baseline metrics:
- Clean CIFAR-10 (pretrained): 86.70% top-1
- Example corruption effects (severity 1 → severity 5 where shown):
  - brightness: 81.40% → 54.92%
  - contrast:   81.95% → 56.30%
  - defocus_blur: 75.31% → 22.43%  <-- most severe drop observed
  - elastic_transform: 80.26%

Observations:
- Pretrained compact model performs well on clean data but is vulnerable to common corruptions.
- Blur-related corruptions (defocus/motion/zoom) cause the largest accuracy drops at high severity.
- Photometric corruptions (brightness/contrast) and noise types produce moderate-to-large performance degradation.

Next steps (Week 3):
1. Design fine-tuning recipe focusing on blur + representative noise/photometric corruptions.
2. Implement fine-tune cell: unfreeze last N layers, use Adam lr=1e-4, early stopping on validation.
3. Run small-scale fine-tuning experiments and compare metrics to baseline.
4. Update README with reproducibility steps and save final results in results/.
